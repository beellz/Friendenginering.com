- **Cross Domain Copy-Paste** - (SCSS is like CSS with better formatting. CSS is a language that adds style to your webpages. Using SCSS Support, we can add a ton of functionality to the previous CSS like a variable, nestings, etc. SCSS as additional support makes it a lot easier in comparison to traditional CSS. You can now use this functionality with the new feature in our latest update. All you need to do is, set as you like and use it as many times as you want! Example- repeating #ff0000 many times in your CSS file is tiresome. But in SCSS, you can just set $red: #ff0000 once and use it as many times as you want.)
- **Flexi Duplicator** - (Fond of The Layout that you created recently on your WordPress Website?

If you love a particular section in one of your sites and you are willing to recreate that on the other then please stop thinking about recreating it all over again. Cross Domain Copy-Paste helps you to directly copy from one location and simply paste it on the other domain location in about 2 seconds!)
